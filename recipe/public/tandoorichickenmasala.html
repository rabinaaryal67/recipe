 <h1>How to create tandoori chicken masala</h1>
 <h2>A spicy roasted chicken marinated in rich spices.</h2>
 <p>1.In a bowl with several chicken pieces, marinate heavily with spices (cumin, red pepper, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, pepper), salt and yogurt. Remember to make deep cuts to the chicken to ensure spices flow in. Leave to absorb for several hours.</p>
 <p>2.Fry chopped onion pieces with garlic and ginger (either crushed or as a paste) in a pan with vegetable oil. When they turn brown, add the chicken and more spices like cinnamon and nutmeg and cook for 20 minutes.</p>
 <p>3.As you cook the chicken, flip on both sides to ensure one side is not raw. It is recommended to serve with salad and rice.</p>
