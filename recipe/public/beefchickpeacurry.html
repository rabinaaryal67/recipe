 <h1>How to create beef chickpea curry</h1>
 <p>1.Chop pieces of raw beef into small pieces to be later marinated and cooked. With bones, cut as much meat from around it as possible.</p>
 <p>2.In a bowl with several chicken pieces (each piece with cuts to ensure spices can flow in), marinate heavily with spices (cumin, red pepper, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, pepper), salt and yogurt.</p>
 <p>3.Fry chopped onion pieces with garlic and ginger paste in a pot with vegetable oil. When they turn brown, add the chicken and more spices like cinnamon and nutmeg and cook for 20 minutes. Add several cups of water to avoid chicken being dry.</p>
 <p>4.Dump the rice over the cooked chicken. Add more salt, chopped/unchopped chilli peppers, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves, as well as some chopped onion pieces. Stir the food to ensure there are meat pieces on top.</p>
 <p>5.Pour several cups of water over the mixture, and boil further until all water is removed. Once finished boiling, one can add peeled boiled eggs to the dish, and serve with salad.</p>
